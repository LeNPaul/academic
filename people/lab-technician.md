title: "Who Wrote the Disputed Essays?"
---

This project is building clustering models using clustering and decision tree models for defining the authorship of disputed essays in the given dataset. R code is available on the [Link](https://github.com/joyinning/r_projects_repo/blob/main/Disputed-Essay_Clustering_030523.md)

## Goal 
The goal is to find which person wrote the dispute essays, Hamilton or Madison, using a clustering algorithm with the K-Means and HAC(Hierarchical Algorithm Clustering) functions. <br>
- To provide evidence for each function to demonstrate the learned patterns. <br>
- To figure out the location of the papers with joint authorship.<br>

## Conclusion
1. The purpose of this analysis is to find the author of each disputed essay (Hamilton or Madison). <br>
- We used these algorithms: Hierarchical Clustering Algorithms with hclust() and agnes(), Divisive Clustering Algorithm with diana(), SimpleKMeans(), kmeans(). <br>
2. The result of kmeans() would be acceptable and understandable. <br>
- In conclusion, we would say one of the essays are written by Madison, while the others cannot be defined. <br>
