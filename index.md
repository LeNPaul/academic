I love analyzing, modeling and visualizing data to deliver informative insights to people. I am a number person, a team player, and a person who enjoys challenges and new projects. And I use '**Joy'** as my nickname. <br>
<br>
I'm currently studying data modeling using machine learning techniques at Syracuse University. Before coming to the United States, I have three years of professional experience in Business Analytics, Accounting/Finance, and Customer Experience Management based in the New York Metropolitan Area and Seoul, South Korea. More details about myself are available on the [Resume](https://joyinning.github.io/cv) page.
