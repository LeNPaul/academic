    <h1>About</h1>
    <p><p>This repository contains a simple framework for starting your own Jekyll project. It was created out of a need to have a simple and quick framework to build my Jekyll sites from. I noticed that there were a number of things that were common among all of my Jekyll sites, from certain best practices for web development, to ways that I liked to do things, to certain styles that I always used.</p>

<p>Instead of always starting from a blank slate and having to look through my past work to find what I needed, or having to always strip down the default the Jekyll theme before I even start adding my own code, I decided to take all of the lessons and best practices that I learned from building my first few Jekyll sites, and distill them into a simple framework for starting my next Jekyll project. Hopefully, this may interest some of you who are looking to build your own Jekyll sites, and would like a framework to start from.</p>

<p>Head over to the Github repository for everything you need to know to get started using this framework.</p>
